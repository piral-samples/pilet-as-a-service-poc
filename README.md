> Proof of concept for a pilet-as-a-service idea

:zap: Contains some very generic pilets that may be thrown into any application providing instant value.

## Getting Started

The [demo is available online](https://piral-samples.github.io/pilet-as-a-service-poc/).

You could go into each directory and install / run it. For instance, for the `Instant-pilet` it looks like this:

```sh
cd Instant-pilet
npm install
npm start
```

## Todo

- [ ] Replace `siteless` with custom shell
- [ ] Publish a website somewhere with more detailed demo
- [ ] Introduce web app with pilet marketplace

## More Information

The basic idea is that pilets can be also very generic and provide generic value. This way, you could either share pilets across your app shells, or in the best case across any web app. A generic carrier script may be utilized to give your web app superpowers - make it configurable on the fly without any deployment or change of state.
